# move-files
This project has been made because of my mother.
She needs to move files from her camera into PC and she doesn't know how to do it,
so I made this program.

At first I thought that I would try to do it in Bash,
but I have gone with Python, which I haven't used before
and then I thought few days later that I could try to rewrite it in Rust,
which I also haven't used before.

I am pretty sure that I didn't hit Rustic or Pythonic writing standards, but for this
type of project it should not matter.

It was quite nice experience to write in two languages I haven't used before,
took me few hours to figure it out, but ultimately I think I am satisfied
as I needed to create program that would execute with one click and this does it
together with .desktop file.
